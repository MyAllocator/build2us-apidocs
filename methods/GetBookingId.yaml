  operationId: get_booking_id
  description: |-
    Returns detailed bookings made on the OTA.

    The booking format is described
    [here in full detail](https://github.com/MyAllocator/build2us-apidocs/blob/gh-pages/booking_format_b2u.md).

    Most fields are optional. This specification lists only the minimum required
    fields to be eligable for a successful Build-To-Us integration.

    Prices: Send us sell rates (rates including taxes and fees). The sum of all
    room prices should equal the `TotalPrice` field. Day rates should be per
    unit, so the sum of all day rates multiplied by the number of units should
    equal the room price.

    Country codes: For CustomerCountry and CustomerNationality (if you include
    those fields) make sure to pass the country code as uppercase Alpha-2
    ISO-3166 codes.

    Currency codes: Make sure they are valid ISO-4217 (uppercase).

    Make sure to provide `OrderDate` and `OrderTime`. They have be provided in
    UTC.

    Guest's credit/debit card details can be provided with the `Payments` field.

    Implementation suggestions: when testing make sure the myallocator test
    property has "download bookings" enabled or the booking will be saved in a
    queue and not visible during testing. To enable login and go to MANAGE /
    General Details / Download new bookings from channels. Default setting
    is "Off". Once enabled please allow 30 minutes for the backend to start
    processing bookings. Also there may be a normal 1-2 minute period after a
    `GetBookingId` response before the booking is visible in the
    inbox.myallocator.com interface (the bookings are held in a temporary queue
    on our backend).
