  operationId: ari_update
  description: |-
    This call is used to send availability, rates and restrictions to your OTA.
    We will combine the updates into as few date ranges as possible, and we
    split bigger updates into several API requests. We also cache data and will
    not send ARI updates if the ARI data has not changed within a certain
    timeframe. You can ask us to alter the numer of `Inventory` objects we send
    per request. It's also possible to ask us to restrict maximum number of days
    per date range.

    Note that myallocator only supports availability on the room level, so for
    the same `ota_room_id` and the same date range the availability will always
    be the same. Only restrictions and rates are sent on the rate plan level.
